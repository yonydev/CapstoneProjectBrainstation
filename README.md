## Fraud Prevention on Vending Machines

### Overview

**The Problem Area:**

Fraud within vending machine operations and the associated delivery routes poses a significant challenge for companies. Unauthorized access, tampering, and theft compromise the integrity of transactions and impact the overall efficiency and profitability of the vending business.

Vending machine operators, route drivers, and the company management are the primary stakeholders facing these challenges. They would benefit from a robust fraud detection system that enhances security, minimizes losses, and ensures the smooth functioning of vending operations.

**The big idea:**

Machine learning can provide solutions by analyzing patterns and anomalies in data to predict potential vulnerabilities. By leveraging historical data on transactions, machine statuses, and driver routes, the system can identify unusual activities and trigger alerts or interventions to prevent fraudulent behavior. Research on similar applications of machine learning in fraud detection, such as anomaly detection algorithms and predictive modeling, will inform the project approach.

### Data Overview

Transaction Data:
